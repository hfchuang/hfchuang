Perth, Australia (CNN) -- Bad weather brought an early end to Thursday's aerial search for traces of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in the southern Indian Ocean, authorities said.
But five ships in the area are trying to keep up the hunt for debris despite the difficult conditions.
All the planes that had flown out to the search zone are returning to Perth, the western Australian city where they set out from, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. It initially reported that the ships were leaving the search area, too, but later said they would stay.
